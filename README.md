# 📋 Weather App (Semantic & Mobile First)

A modern weather forecast application, built with a focus on **accessibility**, **mobile performance**, and **clean code**. This project consumes real-time data from the OpenWeather API to provide accurate climate information with a seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Technologies and Concepts

For this project, I prioritized web development best practices and modern standards:

### 🏗️ Architecture & Semantics
* **Semantic HTML5:** Full use of structural tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` to ensure better SEO and screen reader compatibility.
* **A11y (Accessibility):** Implementation of `aria-live` attributes for dynamic updates and high-contrast color palettes.

### 📱 Styling Strategy
* **Mobile First CSS:** Styling logic starting from the smallest screens up, using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for fluid responsiveness without unnecessary media query bloat.
* **Custom Properties:** Usage of CSS Variables for easy theme maintenance.

### ⚙️ Logic & Workflow
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Robust implementation of `Async/Await` and `Fetch API` for real-time data manipulation and error handling.
* **Git Flow:** Professional version management through organized branches:
    * `main`: Production-ready code.
    * `develop`: Integration branch for new features.
    * `feature/*`: Granular task development.
